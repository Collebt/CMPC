# Learning to Find the Optimal Correspondence between SAR and Optical Image Patches


## Project Page:
See this [page](https://Collebt.github.io/CMPC).

## Overview
We design a cross-modal visual geo-localization framework to prdict the accurate location of SAR patch from satellite database with cross-modal feature embedding and scene-graph modules.


## Dataset 
The Optical-SAR Patch Correspondence Dataset.
Download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KXbHCG47QnmvWWBGzroBZdkIy79tDXZp), and put them on the directory `dataset/SN6-CMPC`.

## Code 
Cross-modality patch correspondence code.
See it from [github](https://github.com/Collebt/CMPC_code)
